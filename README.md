# Classical-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Evaluating various machine learning classifiers on the Digits Dataset using Python and Scikit-Learn.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build and compare multiple classical machine learning models for digit classification. The models were trained and tested using an 80/20 data split, and their performance was evaluated using metrics such as:

- Balanced Accuracy
- ROC AUC (macro-averaged)
- Confusion Matrices

## üöÄ Classification Methods Used

We implemented and fine-tuned the following classifiers:

- Logistic Regression
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

## üîß Hyperparameter Tuning

Each model was initially run using default parameters, followed by hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search Cross-Validation to identify the optimal configurations.

## üìà Results and Evaluation

The models were evaluated through visualizations like ROC curves (combined into a single graph for comparison) and confusion matrices, along with detailed performance metrics.

## üß† Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook

## üìç Conclusion

 This jupyter notebook showcases the implementation, evaluation, and comparison of various machine learning models for the digit classification loaded from Sckit Learmn , combining solid theoretical foundations with practical experimentation.
